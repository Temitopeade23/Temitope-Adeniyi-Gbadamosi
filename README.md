## 👋 About Me

Hi there! I'm a **DevOps/DevSecOps Engineer** with a strong foundation in **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)**. My work focuses on delivering **secure**, **scalable**, and **efficient** solutions by integrating automation and security into every stage of the software development lifecycle.

### What I Do:
- **Automating Workflows**: Streamlining CI/CD pipelines to ensure faster, more reliable builds, tests, and deployments.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Using tools like Terraform and Ansible to build scalable and version-controlled infrastructure.
- **Software Supply Chain Security**: Identifying and mitigating risks in dependencies, third-party tools, and pipelines to safeguard the entire software supply chain.
- **Vulnerability Management**: Embedding automated security checks, conducting threat modeling, and performing regular risk assessments to address vulnerabilities proactively.
- **Monitoring and Observability**: Implementing systems to ensure applications remain performant, reliable, and secure.
- **Compliance Integration**: Aligning workflows with industry standards such as **PCI-DSS**, **ISO 27001**, and **NIST CSF** to meet compliance requirements without slowing down delivery.
- **Secure Development Practices**: Enforcing secure coding standards to improve code quality and reduce risks.

### How My GRC Expertise Enhances DevOps/DevSecOps:
With my experience in **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)**, I bring a unique perspective to DevSecOps, bridging the gap between technical implementation and compliance requirements. This ensures that security and compliance are embedded seamlessly into automated workflows, resulting in systems that are both resilient and aligned with industry standards.

Every project I work on aims to strike the perfect balance between **speed**, **security**, and **compliance**, empowering teams to deliver software that is both innovative and responsible.

Let’s connect and collaborate on building secure, scalable, and efficient solutions for the future!

## Governance Risk and Compliance Projects  
1. ### Risk Assessment for a FinTech Startup

**Problem:**  
A FinTech startup required a comprehensive risk assessment to identify vulnerabilities and ensure the development of a robust Information Security Management System (ISMS) as part of ISO 27001 implementation.

**Action:**  
- Conducted an asset-based risk assessment, analyzing threats and vulnerabilities specific to the FinTech industry.  
- Evaluated risks based on likelihood and impact, categorizing them into a risk matrix.  
- Recommended risk treatment plans to mitigate high-priority risks.  
- Documented the entire process, aligning with ISO 27001 standards.  
- Delivered a detailed report, including actionable insights, a risk matrix, and suggested controls.

**Result:**  
Provided actionable insights and strategies that enhanced the startup's security posture and supported its journey toward ISO 27001 certification.

2. ### PCI-DSS Implementation for a FinTech Startup

**Problem:**  
A FinTech startup needed to ensure compliance with PCI-DSS standards for secure payment processing systems.

**Action:**  
- Conducted a detailed PCI-DSS gap assessment to identify areas of non-compliance and proposed remediation strategies.  
- Developed an Excel-based compliance tracking workbook with dynamic features for issue tracking, gap analysis, and milestone monitoring.  
- Designed a comprehensive remediation plan addressing critical controls, such as data encryption, network segmentation, and access management.  
- Drafted PCI-DSS-compliant policies and procedures that were aligned with industry standards for secure payment processing systems.

**Result:**  
The FinTech startup received actionable strategies and tools for achieving PCI-DSS compliance, ensuring secure payment processing and aligning with regulatory requirements.
